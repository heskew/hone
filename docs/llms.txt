# Hone

> Personal finance software you actually own.

Hone is a self-hosted tool that finds wasteful spending in your bank transactions: zombie subscriptions, price increases, and duplicate services.

## Overview

- **Privacy-first**: CSV import only, no bank credentials, encrypted database
- **Self-hosted**: Runs on your machine or homelab
- **AI-optional**: Local Ollama integration for smarter classification
- **Open source**: MIT license

## What It Does

1. Import transactions from your bank (CSV export)
2. Detect subscriptions automatically
3. Find waste:
   - Zombie subscriptions (forgotten recurring charges)
   - Price increases (services that raised prices)
   - Duplicate services (multiple streaming apps, etc.)
4. Track spending with reports and tags

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Rust (Axum), SQLite with SQLCipher encryption
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- AI: Ollama (optional, runs locally)
